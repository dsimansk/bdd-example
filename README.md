BDD, Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver Example
============================================

This is the repository that goes along with the presentation I did on
the on the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) using Cucumber and
Selenium WebDriver.

Use `mvnw` to run the example and `mvnw spring-boot:run` to run the
standalone app.

You can find Cucumber Gherkin feature file in
`src/test/resources/com/github/zregvart/bdd/example/Cameleers.feature`,
and the corresponding implentation in
`src/test/java/com/github/zregvart/bdd/example`.
